" Beginners .vimrc
" v0.1 2012-10-22 Philip Thrasher

" Important things for beginners:
" * Start out small... Don't jam your vimrc full of things you're not ready to
"   immediately use.
" * Read other people's vimrc's.
" * Use a plugin manager for christ's sake! (I highly recommend vundle)
" * Spend time configuring your editor... It's important. Its the tool you
"   spend 8 hours a day crafting your reputation.
" * remap stupid things to new keys that make you more efficient.
" * Don't listen to the haters that complain about using non-default
"   key-bindings. Their argument is weak. I spend most of my time in the editor
"   on my computer, not others, so I don't care if customizing vim means I'll
"   have a harder time using remote vim.
"
" Below I've left some suggestions of good default settings to have in a bare
" minimal vimrc. You only what you want to use, and nothing more. I've heavily
" commented each, and these are what I consider bare necessities, my workflow
" absolutely depends on these things.
"
